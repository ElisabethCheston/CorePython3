    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakensheild</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King Fundin, the
            father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
            Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to
            reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company
            as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later
            settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
            brother of Óin.
        
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
            and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.
        
            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
            2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
            that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as
            "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet
            new from the shell".

            Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
            accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
            advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.
        
            He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he
            was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

            Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of
            the Rings.
        
            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and
            later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to
            voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and
            Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo
            Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
        
            Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the Undying
            Lands.
